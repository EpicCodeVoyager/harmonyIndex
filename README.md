Harmony Index:

It is location-based approximation of people’s collaborative attitude towards the idea of harmony. 

Harmony definition:
 It is the ability of a group of people to sustain, develop and integrate each member of group in its unified pursuit of vison which is independent of the external factors. 

As mentioned in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-013-0439-z
HI can’t be absolutely possible to figure out, In this approach it is a derived value based on the available data.

Also reference to Happiness index calculation as well.
 
However, from a practical standpoint it is to be assumed if a location and its local groups have the higher ability to maintain harmony, they should have following characteristics: 

•	Lower crime rates. 
•	Lower unemployment. 
•	Higher education.
•	Lower stress levels.
•	Lower mental health related problems.
•	Lower critical requirements of emergency cases in hospitals (for eg. Till age 15-19 )
•	Lower accidents on road.
•	Availability of Education institutes, hospitals, hobby centers, affordable facilities to learn and educate. 
•	Satisfactory early childhood education in a safer, stress free environment. 
•	Minimum number of Neighborhood society which are considered unsafe to visit.
•	Number of kids living in unsafe neighborhood society, basically where crime rate is higher. 
•	Higher job satisfaction
•	Higher equality among opposite sex
•	Lower domestic violence 
•	Overall happiness index
•	Empowered kids
•	Access to opportunities
•	Teen pregnancy 
•	suicide rate below 15 and above 75 of the age.
•	Health wise BMI Data.






Possible data collection points: 
Age
Location
Salary
Sex
Married status
Having Kids
Job satisfaction
Medical records
Higher Financial debt
Stress Levels
Neighborhood office category (heavy/severe/heinous crimes crime rate)
Neighborhood home category (crime rate)
Shoplifting incidents
Teen arrests, sexual assault, murders, domestic violence 

Factors: 
Retirement Age
Old age health
Life expectancy

Please add more.

The idea is to find correlation coefficient between all these data by taking all possible subsets of this based on 
Fixed : location/age/Sex.

Changing variables: All possible subsets of above values. 
Defining a correlation threshold and keeping higher co-relation values together.
Applying these higher correlation factors to other location as well and reviewing the result.
Generating report with final heat map on the map of whole Europe.

Once all the relevant data is collected to this list, the following mathematical calculations to be used for calculating the final index value using python (any language) : 

The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A calculated number greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 means that there was an error in the correlation measurement.
